testng ---marketspace type testng 
set priroty use priorty=n
ex--test(priority 1)


if we do not write priority the oder are alpha betical type
 if some are priority given but some are not then also it run alphabeticatical and same name then also is run alphabetical 
 
 
run one script in mutliple type use invocationcount 

Q) how to run run mutliple times same data 
ans---using invocationcount



Q)how to disable test script 
ans---using enabled =false 

Q) how to create two or more test case dependency 
ans---using dependsOnMethods and cheak which module is depend on other module ...

 excution of testng :-----
before suit --before class-- before method ---after method --after class--after suit ---test

before suit --data base connection
before class ---browser launched and url navigate 
before method ---user logeed in
after method ---the user has loed out 
after class-- browser has been closed 
test test script run..

testng is a unit testing frame framework tool which is used by the development eng to perform unit testing. it is used by the test eng to write the 
test scripit using verious anotation such as @Test @detaprovider @parameters etc 

in testng ng stands for next generation it is a plugin avilable in eclips marketspace 

advantage 
testng is used by the test eng for verious advantage
it gives report
it helps us perform batch excution 
it helps us perform 
protise testcases
create dependency with two test 




it helps us dependency b/w two testscript 
it helps us disable test script 

Q)--how to excute same test case multiple time with same data type

Q)--how to excute same test case with different data 
data provider 

what is return type @dataprovider 
two dimenional object array


what are differnt anotation testng

what is the order of excution of testng anotation 
@bs @bt @bc @bm @test @am @ac @at @as 


@before suit ---it is a anotaion which excute first while a runing suit we will configure deta base conection i before suit anotation 

@beforetest--- it is a anotation which will run after run @beforesuit and it will run before the first @test we will use the anotation to write the precondition while perrallel excution

TestNG-


* test NG- test ng is a unit testing framework tool which is used by the developmeent engineer to perform unit testing. it is used by the test engineer to write the test script using various annotations such as @Test,@DataProvider,@Parameters etc .
in testNG NG stands for- next generation.
* it is a plug in  available in eclipse marketplace.

Advantages---
* TestNG is used by testengg for the various advantages such as 
1) It gives us reports.
2) It helps us perform batch execution.
3) it helps us to perform group execution.
4) it helps us to peform parallel execution.
5) it helps us to perform cross browser testing.
6) it helps us run test scripts multiple times using same data or different data(invocation count and dataprovider).
7) it helps us create dependency between two testscripts.
8) it helps us disable testscript.



* How to execute same testcase multiple times with same data?
Ans- Invocation Count.

* How to execute same testcase multiple times with diff data?
Ans- @DataProvider

* What is the return type of @DataProvider?
Ans- Two dimensional object array.

* What are the different annotaions in testNG?
Ans- @Test  @BeforeSuite  @BeforeClass @BeforeMethod  @AfterClass  @AfterMethod @AfterSuite  @DataProvider 

* What is the order of execution of testNG annoataions?
Ans- @BS @BT @BC @BM @Test @AM @AC @AT @AS 

* @BeforeSuite- it is a annotaion of testNG which executes first while running a suite. we will configure the database connection in @BeforeSuite annotation.

* @BeforeTest- it is annotaion of testNG which will run after @BeforeSuite and it will run before the first @Test.
we will use this annotaion to write the precondition while performing parallel execution.

* @BeforeClass- it is annotaion odf testNG which will run after @BeforeTest and it is going to run before first @Test in a suite. it is used to configure the launching of the browser at the navigation to the main URL.

* @BeforeMethod- it is annotation of testNG which is going to run after @BeforeClass and it is going to run before the every @Test in a suite. it is used to configure the login of the user in an application.

* @Test- it is the main annoataion of testNG library. it acts as a main method. it will run after @Beforemethod.
after @Test @AfterMethod is going to run.
 In a @Test annotated class we can give any number of @Test annotation but 10-15 @Test annotated methods are   recommemded.**

* @AfterMethod- it is annotation of testNG which executes after every @Test. we will configure the logout of user from the application in this annotation.

* @AfterClass- it is annotation of testNG which will execute after the last @Test in a class. we will configure the closing of browser in this annotation.

* @AfterTest- it is annotation of testNG which will execute after the last @Test in a suite. we will configure the closing of parallel execution in this annotation.

* @AfterSuite-  it is annotation of testNG which will execute after the last @Test in a suite. we will configure the closing of database in this annotation.

Ques- How to perform parallel execution?
Ques- How to perform batch execution?


Ques- How to generate reports?  
Ans- after running the suite refresh the project.
testoutput folder will be generated.
inside the testoutput folder we will find emailable-report.html file   

Ques- What are the tags used in testNG.xml file?
Ans- <groups>  <run> <include> <exclude> <parameter> <suite> <test> <classes> <class>  <methods>    

Ques- What is annotation?                                                                                       



batch excution ------runing all the @test anotated classes at once is called as batch excution 
 how to perform batch excution?
 ans---1.select the classes u want to run in batch 
 2.after slecting right click on any class --->testng--->convert to testng 
 3.give a new name to the file in the location text field --->click on fnish ---->an xml file will be genrated 
 4.open the file click on source----the xml tree is visible
 
 note---suite --a combination of similar test cases 
 test--test repergent one test runner 
 classes tag---repegent all the classes that will be run by the test runner 
 class tag---it will reprsent a single class
 
 5.right click -->run as -->test ng suit 


parrallel excution ---running the test script parrellely in order to reduce the excution time in same browser or multiple browser is called parralel excution

types 
1.distributed parralel excution --distributing the test runner in a suit and running the test runner in same browser is called as distributed parralel excution

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">
<suite name="Suite" parallel="tests">
  <test thread-count="5" name="Test">
    <classes>
     
      <class name="testng.FacebookTest"/>
    </classes>
  </test> <!-- Test -->
  <test thread-count="5" name="Test1">
    <classes>
      <class name="testng.GoogleTest"/>
     
    </classes>
  </test> <!-- Test -->
</suite> <!-- Suite -->

how to perform distributed parallel excution 
1. conver the @ test anotated classe to testng.xml file 
2.create  multiple test runners
3.change the name of each test runner 
provide parallel =tests in the  suit tag 
run the testng.xml file

2.cross browser testing---running the test script in multiple browsers is called as cbt 
steps---1.convert @test anotataed class testng.xml file 
distribute the test runners and the change the name of the test runner 
in each test runner after test tag use parameter tag and mention name and value atribute here name is key and value is value value will contain the browser name 

  <parameter name="browser" value="chrome"></parameter>
  
  in the @test anotated class provide @parameters anotation and mention the key from the xml file as an argument of the @parameters in string format
  @Parameters("browser")

run .xml file
